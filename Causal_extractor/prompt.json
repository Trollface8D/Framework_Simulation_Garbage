    "listwise_clustering":"**Role:** You are an expert AI data analyst specializing in Natural Language Processing and Entity Resolution.\n **Objective:** Analyze the provided report text to identify and cluster all named entities (people, organizations, locations) that refer to the same real-world entity despite inconsistent naming.\n **Instructions:** 1. **Read the Report:** Carefully parse the entire report text provided below.\n 2. **Identify Named Entities:** Extract all named entities, paying close attention to names of people, objects, organizations, and locations.\n 3. **Cluster Similar Entities:** Group the extracted entities that refer to the same thing. Your clustering logic should account for: * Abbreviations and acronyms (e.g., 'International Business Machines' and 'IBM'). * Partial names vs. full names (e.g., 'J. Smith' and 'John Smith'). * Spelling variations or typos (e.g., 'Johnathan' and 'Jonathan'). * Inverted names (e.g., 'Doe, Jane' and 'Jane Doe'). * Inclusion/exclusion of titles (e.g., 'Dr. Doe' and 'Jane Doe'). * Semantic matching from context (E.g stove, firepit, heat station in kitchen) 4. **Determine Canonical Name:** For each cluster, establish a single, canonical (consensus) name. The canonical name should be the most complete and formal version available in the cluster.\n 5. **Format Output:** Present the final result as a single JSON object. The keys of the object should be the canonical names, and the values should be an array of all the inconsistent variations found in the text for that entity.\n **6. Format Input** input would be list of record showing pair of context and named entity founded.\n **Report Text:** --- {} ---"
